# Improving performance with C#

1) Perfomance is about how fast our software is.
2) We should care a lot about problems with memory usage ou just throw hardware at it? <br>
Allocate human work to resolve this problem is more expensive than just throw more hardware.
3) "If you can fix a problem by throwing hardware at it, you should". Is it right?
4) Optimization should be just-in-time.
5) There are two optimization anti-patterns: <br>
  <strong>Premature Optimization</strong>: "One of the biggest traps for smart engineers is optimizing something that shouldn't exist" - Elon Musk<br>
  <strong>Goldplating</strong>: An anti-pattern that happens when a developer continues to work on a particular task long past the point where any work on that task was useful. 
6) 80% of the poor performance of your application comes from 20% of the code
7) Struct vs Class. When to use struct: <br><br>
